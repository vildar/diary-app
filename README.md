# React Diary Application
This is a very basic application which allows the user to add, edit, delete, sort and filter through notes.

To run the application:
`npm run start`

Alternatively, use this preview link:
[Diary App]()

##Note
The function used to calculate the week number from the date is not highly accurate. It provides the correct solution
in most of the use cases.
